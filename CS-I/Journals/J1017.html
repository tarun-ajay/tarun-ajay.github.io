    <h2>1.1 What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h2>
    <h3>It looks like the AND functions truth table.</h3>
    <h2>1.2 What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h2>
    <h3>It looks like the XOR functions truth table.</h3>
    <h2>2.1 What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h2>
    <h3>They both look like the AND functions truth table.</h3>
    <h2>2.2 Why is this true?</h2>
    <h3>Because it has the truth table of the AND function. And the AND function is when both X and Y are true.</h3>
    <h2>3.1 Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h2>
    <h3>Because the half-adder adds lesser bits than the full-adder.</h3>
    <h2>3.2 Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h2>
    <h3>Yes because you are putting all the correct inputs.</h3>
    <h2>3.3 Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h2>
    <h3>Either one of the nnumbers is might be 14 while the other might be bigger than one. This is known as the x AND NOT y.</h3>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <h3>I learned about full-addder and hals-adders.</h3>
    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <h3>I didn't encounter any challenges.</h3>
    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <h3>It doesn't have to be improved.</h3>
    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <h3>This has affected my learning by telling me how to use and when to use a full-adder or a half-adder.</h3>
