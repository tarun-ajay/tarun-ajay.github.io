    <h1><i>My short story</i></h1>

    <h2>It was bright and happy everywhere except this one area; it was the basement. I always wondered why it was caged off, then I found out there were dead bodies in there, from 22 years ago. The dead bodies were kids bodies who had died because there was a serial killer in that school. The serial killer was a teacher;  his name was Donald Konoger. He was known to be one of the deadliest and craziest killers of that time. He murdered hundreds of people and most of them were kids from his school. He stored all of their bodies in the basement, which made it haunted since they died in a very bad and unsettling way. Donald eventually got caught when one of his preys escaped and called the cops. Donald was doing this for around 3 years; he was ruthless. But even though the cops knew that there was a serial killer on the loose, they did nothing, so Donald was still there murdering and killing people and storing them in the schools basement for another 2 years. 5 years later Donald was finally caught, and that was thanks to Richard Dolliver. It wasnâ€™t easy, though, Richard had to find him, which was hard because Donald was very talented and left no trails on what he was doing. But eventually Richard found Donald in an RV in Florida, US. He then arrested him and put him in jail for life. Donald then went to jail and died in it due to him getting beaten to death by one of his cellmates. Since they thought that he was a horrible person, even though they themselves are criminals.</h2>
