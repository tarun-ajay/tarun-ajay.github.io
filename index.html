    <h3>Hello my name is Tarun Ajay. Some stuff I like are video games like fifa,a bit of  apex legends, and a bit of rocket league. But I mainly like Fifa. Some sports that I like to play are badminton, running, and soccer/football. A few more things about me is that I am pretty fast at running and I don't know how to swim. I also like the series, The Flash and a bit of anime. I like a few subjects like PE, a bit of Algebra, and I like to draw sometimes(even tho I am bad at drawing).</h3>

    <h1>Why is a Digital Portfolio important</h1>
     <h3>I think it is important because it presents the best work of an individual or organization, presented in a digital format. And it also lets others to get to know you more, if you are writing about youself, or it can just help them know stuff in general. Like in studies or how to do something.</h3>
